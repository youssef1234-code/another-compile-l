# Best Practices

This guide compiles the key do's and don'ts from the Polaris design system to help you create consistent, professional interfaces.

## Pro Design Language

### ✅ Do's
- Use space efficiently to allow merchants to view more data at once
- Avoid being verbose and make interfaces action-driven with intuitive icons
- Combine motion, color, and depth to create responsive and dynamic interfaces
- Provide clear affordances that enable intuitive interaction
- Create dramatic visual response to primary interaction points
- Make hover transitions smooth and unobtrusive while click feedback feels visceral
- Ensure elements with similar appearance share common behavior
- Use consistent signifiers throughout the user experience

### ❌ Don'ts
- Don't create verbose interfaces that waste space
- Don't confuse users about interactivity - make affordances clear
- Don't create inconsistent behavior for visually similar elements
- Don't break established interaction patterns

## Color Usage

### ✅ Do's
- Use color to support different states merchants need to be informed about
- Use strong, vivid colors to grab attention to things that matter most
- Use color in conjunction with other discernible elements to amplify the message
- Create meaningful combinations of color roles to enhance merchant experience
- Use appropriate color roles for their intended purpose only

### ❌ Don'ts
- Don't use color to decorate or to distract merchants from performing tasks
- Don't contradict or diminish messaging by using subdued colors or grayscale
- Don't use color alone to convey meaning
- Don't use multiple brand roles in the same area - this can confuse merchants
- Don't use info on multiple elements that need attention in the same component
- Don't use info to share statuses or messages that require immediate attention
- Don't use success to entice merchants or to share special offers
- Don't use caution for announcements
- Don't use warning for "under construction" or "coming soon" messaging
- Don't use critical for less important, non-actionable or contradicting messaging
- Don't use magic as a "pop of color" to differentiate elements
- Don't use emphasis to pivot attention to content that is not interactive
- Don't use transparent on elements that require higher affordances like labeled buttons
- Don't use inverse to grab merchant attention on specific elements
- Don't use input color role outside of forms
- Don't use nav colors for other navigational elements like tabs or links

## Depth and Shadows

### ✅ Do's
- Use depth tactically to differentiate between primary and secondary elements
- Use depth to indicate interactive elements so it's obvious what merchants can interact with
- Apply intuitive changes to element's perceived depth upon interaction (push buttons down)
- Use depth to highlight action and large pieces of information that overlay other information
- Use consistent shadow and bevel styles across your interface
- Use gray backgrounds to de-emphasize contained information
- Keep most elements on the same layer to establish visual baseline

### ❌ Don'ts
- Don't overuse depth - it leads to cluttered and confusing interfaces
- Don't add unnecessary depth to elements - depth should relate to importance or interactivity
- Don't allow elements to protrude outside their parent containers
- Don't give static elements unnecessary depth as this can mislead merchants
- Don't apply unexpected changes to element's perceived depth
- Don't use different styles for similar elements
- Don't use too many layers in one screen
- Don't resort to layering as initial tool for emphasis
- Don't use bright or contrasting colors for container backgrounds or borders
- Don't use unique styles for surfaces like inset shadows
- Don't rely solely on depth to create focus

## Icons

### ✅ Do's
- Draw simple objects that are easy to identify
- Reuse parts of other icons in the set to maintain visual harmony
- Use universally recognized icons
- Leverage universally recognized symbols and metaphors to create new icons
- Use icons to replace text for common actions with universally understood icons
- Use icons consistently once a meaning is assigned to them
- Use icons to identify common objects and improve overall clarity
- Align icons vertically with accompanying typography
- Center icons in their containers
- Use simple geometric shapes, angles, and rounded corners
- Use consistent visual style, stroke weight and only one color
- Only use filled icons in the main navigation
- Use filled icons for semi-permanent selected states like pinning an app

### ❌ Don'ts
- Don't embellish icons with unnecessary details
- Don't reinterpret or stylize universally recognized icons
- Don't rely on cultural-specific, niche, or outdated metaphors
- Don't use ambiguous icons without text labels
- Don't overuse icons - redundant icons lead to visual clutter
- Don't resize icons - this distorts the relationship with typography
- Don't use perspective and 3D objects
- Don't use excessive details or organic shapes
- Don't use transparency
- Don't use filled icons to create emphasis

## Layout and Spacing

### ✅ Do's
- Group similar data points or tasks in the same card
- Nest inset shapes and surfaces
- Use size, weight, and contrast to establish hierarchy
- Create compact components for specialized, minute tasks
- Adjust padding in nested tables to optimize use of space
- Nest tables in cards when there's other content in that card
- Pay attention to spacing when creating smaller elements
- Adjust size of shaped elements so they work well with their siblings
- Use divider lines and surface colors to create clear delineation in high density components
- Use different surface colors to style inset surfaces and create visual divisions
- Divide surfaces into grid pattern for complex components that expect an action
- Use high density consistently when offering lists of options
- Split each context into its own card
- Reduce border radius of inset surfaces to create nested look

### ❌ Don'ts
- Don't use divider lines to create visual hierarchy or separation outside of indexes or tables
- Don't contradict importance of a task with its size in the admin
- Don't break symmetry when grouping surfaces together
- Don't make all nested elements have same or larger border radius than their parent
- Don't change border radius of elements like buttons or badges when nesting them
- Don't avoid nesting a table in a card if it's the only content of that card
- Don't divide and organize surfaces vertically by creating columns of unrelated content
- Don't suddenly change density in an action component
- Don't use grid or vertical dividers to create low density layouts
- Don't mix low-density information with high-density component in same card

## General Interface Design

### ✅ Do's
- Prioritize efficiency and intuitive interactions for daily merchant tasks
- Make interfaces action-driven with clear navigation
- Create responsive and dynamic interfaces with clear affordances
- Establish clear visual hierarchy emphasizing important details
- Use space to create groups of related information
- Make interfaces feel like professional software, not websites
- Size elements appropriately based on their job and importance
- Create surfaces that adapt to provide optimized views

### ❌ Don'ts
- Don't create interfaces that feel like websites rather than professional tools
- Don't make merchants work harder than necessary to complete tasks
- Don't create visual competition between elements that confuses priorities
- Don't sacrifice functionality for decoration
- Don't create inconsistent experiences across different parts of the interface

## Accessibility

### ✅ Do's
- Ensure sufficient contrast makes things easier to find, identify, and interact with
- Use color in conjunction with other discernible elements
- Design for all merchants with inclusive approaches
- Provide alternative ways to convey information beyond just visual cues
- Test interfaces with assistive technologies

### ❌ Don'ts
- Don't use color alone to convey meaning
- Don't assume all users perceive visual elements the same way
- Don't create interfaces that exclude users with disabilities
- Don't ignore accessibility standards and guidelines
